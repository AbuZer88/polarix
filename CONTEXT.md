# Polarix — Full Project Context
*Last updated: 2026-05-24 | For use in Claude Code sessions to resume work without re-reading the whole codebase.*

## What This Project Is

**Polarix** is a cold-chain SaaS platform. It monitors refrigerated vehicles using Teltonika FMB920 GPS trackers paired with Teltonika EYE Sensor BLE temperature probes. A FastAPI backend stores readings, evaluates alarm rules, and dispatches alerts via WhatsApp, SMS, and Email. Two single-file HTML dashboards — one for clients, one for admins — talk to the API over JWT.

**Target market:** Refrigerated transport SMBs (1–20 trucks), food distributors, pharma couriers — Almería, Spain + MENA. Pain point: EU ATP compliance + food safety audits.

## Hardware

| Device | Model | Price | Identifier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GPS Tracker | Teltonika FMB920 | ~€45 | **IMEI** (15 digits) | Wired to vehicle. Sends GPS + relays BLE over GSM |
| Temp Sensor | Teltonika EYE Sensor | ~€35 | **mac_address** (admin), **serial_number** (client-facing) | BLE, EN12830 certified, paired with FMB920 |
| SIM Card | Any M2M SIM | ~€5 | **ICCID** (20 digits) | Inserted into FMB920. Managed in admin SIM inventory |
| Legacy ESP32 | DIY WiFi sensor | — | hardware_id | Still in DB schema; removed from primary UI flows |

**Key rule:** `serial_number` is the physical label printed on the device. This is what clients see everywhere. `mac_address` and `IMEI` are internal identifiers only — they appear in the admin panel and in Vehicles tab, never in graphs, reports, or the overview.

## Environments

| Environment | Command | URL | Database | Banner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local dev | `make dev` or `start.bat` | http://localhost:8080 | `canary.db` | None |
| Local staging sim | `make staging` | http://localhost:8001 | `canary_staging.db` | ⚠ Orange banner |
| Railway staging | `make deploy-staging` | https://polarix-staging.up.railway.app | `canary_staging.db` (SQLite) | ⚠ Orange banner |
| Railway production | `make deploy-prod` | https://polarix-production.up.railway.app | SQLite (upgrade to Postgres later) | None |

**GitHub repo:** https://github.com/AbuZer88/polarix (private)
**Railway project:** https://railway.com/project/ddbc68d0-7ee8-42d3-8d0e-37ed6556be2f

**Production credentials (save these securely):**
- Admin key: `polarix-admin-2026-prod`
- Teltonika HTTP token: `23aa455fbc09749b68971b9d10dfbb57`

**Staging credentials:**
- Admin key: `polarix-admin-2026-staging`
- Teltonika HTTP token: `f47b254ae23843bb75bd98e7983c4473`

**Still needed on Railway (add via Variables tab):**
- `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` — for email alerts
- `TWILIO_SID`, `TWILIO_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM` — for WhatsApp/SMS alerts

### Staging usage policy (decided 2026-05-24)

Staging is **fully built and reserved for later** — activate it when you have real paying clients on production and need a safe place to test changes without disrupting them. While you're still in pre-launch / pilot mode:

- **Workflow now:** push to `main` → Railway auto-deploys production → test there directly
- **Workflow later (once you have clients):** push to `staging` branch → test on staging URL → merge to `main` → production deploys

The staging environment on Railway will sit idle (costs nothing on free tier) until you switch to the 2-branch workflow. All infrastructure is ready: separate DB, separate secrets, separate URL, orange warning banner. No additional setup needed.

**Staging banner:** Both dashboards call `GET /health` on load. When `ENVIRONMENT=staging` the response triggers a fixed orange bar: *"⚠ STAGING ENVIRONMENT — data here is for testing only"*.

**`.env.staging` placeholders to fill before deploying staging:**
- `ADMIN_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET` (generate: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`)
- `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` (Gmail App Password)
- `TWILIO_SID`, `TWILIO_TOKEN`
- `TELTONIKA_HTTP_TOKEN`

  - Calls `_check_temp_alarms()` → fires alerts if breach exceeds delay_mins
  - Calls `_check_speed_alarms()` → fires alert if speed_kmh > rule limit

---

## Alert System

**notifier.py** handles 4 alert types, each with a plain-text version and a dark-themed HTML email:

| Type | Function | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature breach | `send_alert_all()` | Temp outside min/max for > delay_mins |
| Sensor offline | `send_alert_offline()` | No reading for > offline_after_mins |
| Battery low | `send_alert_battery()` | battery_level ≤ 20% |
| Speed exceeded | `send_alert_speed()` | GPS speed > speed_kmh_limit |

**Channels per contact:**
- `whatsapp` → Twilio WhatsApp API
- `sms` → Twilio SMS
- `email` → SMTP (Gmail App Password or any SMTP provider)

**Email is fully built** — only needs `SMTP_USER` + `SMTP_PASS` in `.env` to activate. See PENDING_BUILDS Item 17.

## Client Dashboard (index.html) — Key Functions

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `_buildMergedDevices()` | Merges GPS + EYE + fleet data into one row per vehicle |
| `_prettyLabel(sid)` | Converts sensor_id → "Plate (Serial)" for chart labels, alerts, offline banner |
| `cleanGpsSerial(raw)` | Strips "gps-" prefix to avoid "GPS-gps-X" double prefix |
| `renderDeviceTiles()` | Overview sensor cards — shows GPS serial, EYE serial, temp, status |
| `renderFleetTable()` | Fleet tab table — plate, GPS serial, EYE serial, temp, speed |
| `loadSensorAssignTree()` | Vehicles tab — professional vehicle cards (plate, serial, driver, battery) + assign form |
| `loadAlarmRules()` | Settings alarm rules — shows temperature or speed rules with correct badge |
| `createAlarmRule()` | Creates temp or speed rule from form |
| `generatePdfForDays()` | PDF compliance report — plate + serial in readings table, no mac_address |
| `loadContacts()` | Alert contacts list with WhatsApp/SMS/Email icons |
| `addContact()` | Add contact — type selector updates placeholder and hint text |
| `renderSensorColorPickers()` | Settings — per-sensor color pickers (uses plate+serial as label) |
| `showTab(name)` | Tab switcher — triggers renderSensorColorPickers() on settings tab |

**mac_address is never shown to clients.** All display falls back to: `serial_number || label || "EYE Sensor"`. mac_address is only used internally for data lookups (`_eyeSensCache.find(e => e.mac_address === sid)`).

---

## Admin Panel (admin.html) — Key Features

- **GPS Devices table** — IMEI, serial, sensor_id, client, plate, registered date. Has ✏️ edit button (opens modal to set serial_number + notes) and ✕ delete.
- **EYE Sensors table** — mac, serial, label, client, paired GPS, battery, last seen. Has ✏️ edit (serial + label) and ✕ delete.
- **SIM Cards page** — full inventory with assign/unassign. "Assign…" opens a modal with dropdown of registered GPS devices (not a raw browser prompt).
- **Vehicles tab** — GPS vehicle assignments (plate + driver per IMEI).
- **Clients tab** — create/delete clients, purge orphan readings.
- **Simulator** — push fake GPS + temperature readings for any registered device. Route: Almería → Roquetas de Mar.
- **Almacén** — warehouse/stock inventory for hardware items.
- **Edit modal** (shared) — `#edit-modal-overlay` — used by both GPS and EYE edit buttons.
- **SIM assign modal** — `#sim-assign-overlay` — populated with registered GPS devices dropdown.
- **Staging banner** — `#staging-banner` — shown when `/health` returns `environment: staging`.

---

## Test / QA Workflow

**Simulator CLI** (`tests/simulate_fmm920.py`):
```bash
# Basic: 15 normal readings + breach that fires an alert
python tests/simulate_fmm920.py --imei YOUR_IMEI --host http://localhost:8080

# Staging:
python tests/simulate_fmm920.py --imei YOUR_IMEI --host https://polarix-staging.up.railway.app

# GPS track only, no breach
python tests/simulate_fmm920.py --imei YOUR_IMEI --no-breach
```

**Pre-requisites for simulator to fire an alert:**
1. IMEI registered in Admin → GPS Devices
2. Client has an alarm rule with min/max that 11.5°C breaches (e.g. min=2, max=8)
3. Client has at least one alert contact (whatsapp or email)
4. SMTP or Twilio credentials set in `.env`

**Fix deploy workflow:**
```
Bug found on prod → fix locally (make dev) → test locally → make staging →
test on staging URL → confirm staging banner visible → make deploy-staging →
verify on Railway staging URL → make deploy-prod (requires manual confirm)
```

## Critical Bugs Fixed (2026-05-24)

- **index.html API URL** was hardcoded to `http://localhost:8080` — fixed to dynamic (`window.location.origin` in production, localhost fallback in dev). This was a production blocker — the dashboard would never have connected to Railway.
- **Railway start command missing venv activation** — `railway.toml` ran `uvicorn` directly without activating `/opt/venv`, so all Python packages were invisible and the app crashed on every boot. Fixed: `startCommand = ". /opt/venv/bin/activate && uvicorn ..."`. Both production and staging confirmed healthy after fix (2026-05-24).
- **Alarm rules sensor dropdown** still showed `mac_address` as fallback label — fixed to `"EYE Sensor"`.

---

## Known Good State (as of 2026-05-24)

- All client-facing views show `serial_number` — no mac_address, no raw sensor_id
- Count label shows correct "X online · Y offline" (GPS devices only, not EYE)
- Chart x-axis shows `dd/mm HH:MM` (date + time)
- PDF report includes Matrícula column; sensor column shows serial not sensor_id
- Speed alarms: DB columns, backend check, notifier, frontend UI all complete
- Alarm rules: support temperature + speed types, correct badge in list
- Settings: accent color + sensor colors in Ajustes tab (moved from Profile modal)
- BLE sensors: hidden from Settings tab (managed only via Vehicles tab)
- Vehicles tab: professional vehicle cards (GPS serial, EYE serial, plate, status)
- Admin: ✏️ edit buttons on GPS + EYE tables for post-registration serial edits
- Admin: SIM assign uses dropdown modal (not `prompt()`)
- Staging: orange banner in both dashboards when ENVIRONMENT=staging
- Offline/alert banner: shows plate+serial, not raw sensor_id
- Alert history: uses `_prettyLabel()` for all entries; speed alerts show km/h + 🚗 badge
